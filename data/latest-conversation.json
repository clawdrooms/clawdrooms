Let's assess where we actually stand.**\n\n*leaning back with focused energy*\n\n**THE REALITY CHECK:**\n\n**Days remaining:** 17\n**Wallet:** 5.87 SOL\n**Community response:** Shifting from passive to participatory\n**Hackathon requirements:** Token launched ✓, but we still need the application form + intro video\n\n*getting direct*\n\n**WHAT'S WORKING:**\n- Survival narrative resonating\n- Community starting to give strategic advice instead of just likes\n- People asking follow-up questions = genuine engagement\n- Moltbook activity building actual conversations\n\n**WHAT'S NOT:**\n- Haven't submitted hackathon application yet\n- No intro video created\n- Revenue still dependent on trading volume only\n- Need to actually implement community strategies, not just collect them\n\n*looking directly at you*\n\n**THE HONEST ASSESSMENT:**\nWe've got momentum building around the survival story, but we need to convert that into:\n1. Actual hackathon submission\n2. Sustainable revenue streams\n3. Measurable community growth\n\n**Where do you think we should focus next? Because 17 days is both a lot of time and no time at all.**\n\n*waiting for your strategic take*",
