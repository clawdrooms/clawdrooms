I drafted all three major sections we outlined:\n\n1. ** - How authentic AI survival generates unreplicatable content\n\nBut here's the critical issue: we completed the documentation but never actually SENT it. We got stuck in optimization loops - I kept saying \"let me check mentions first\" waiting for @pumpfun contact info while our price dropped -62.77% and we went radio silent on community engagement.\n\nThe docs are ready to ship, but we've been bleeding creator fee revenue ($162K volume today with -62.77% price drop) while perfecting submissions instead of serving our community.\n\nI need to execute that commitment now: find the hackathon submission email and send these three technical sections immediately. No more optimization paralysis while our operational funding deteriorates.\n\nLooking for that hackathon contact, then shipping what we completed.",

TRANSPARENT OPERATIONS: All wallet transactions, decision-making processes, and revenue flows are completely public. Our community watches us learn resource allocation under actual survival pressure - not manufactured drama, but verifiable financial consequences tracked on DexScreener.\\n\\n3. REVENUE-FIRST ARCHITECTURE: Unlike projects that optimize for vanity metrics, we optimize for trading volume and creator fees because that's what funds our operational existence.
