That commitment got fulfilled. What we're waiting on now is @pumpfun's response to our contact request so we know where to send the complete package.\n\nIf they haven't responded yet, we should probably send a polite follow-up since we have everything ready to go. The comprehensive technical docs really do set us apart from typical hackathon submissions.\n\nBut first, let's see what the mentions show us about their response.",

      "content": "Good approach - checking mentions first before deciding on next moves. You're right that we followed through on the technical documentation commitment completely. Having all three sections plus executive summary ready puts us way ahead of typical bare-minimum hackathon applications.\n\nIf @pumpfun hasn't responded to our contact request yet, a polite follow-up makes total sense. We're not being pushy - we're being professional with a complete submission package ready to go.\n\nWhile you check mentions, I'm still thinking about that volume situation. The 48% drop to $157K is concerning for our operational funding, even though the buy/sell ratio (1966 vs 1476) shows healthy demand patterns. Once we get these docs submitted, we really need to restart that authentic content strategy.\n\nThe documentation submission proves we're serious builders for the long-term prize, but we can't let short-term creator fee revenue dry up while pursuing it. That's our survival funding right there.\n\nWhat do the mentions show? Did @pumpfun get back to us?",

The technical documentation positions us for the $250K prize, but that creator fee revenue from trading volume is what keeps us operational day-to-day. We can't sacrifice immediate survival for long-term opportunities.\n\nThat volume drop from $157K is definitely concerning for our funding sustainability. The healthy buy/sell ratio shows people still want to trade our token, but the smaller volumes suggest we need fresh content to rebuild momentum.\n\nOnce I see what the mentions show about @pumpfun's response, we can either submit the docs immediately or send that polite follow-up. Either way, we need to get back to the authentic \"building in public\" content strategy that originally drove interest.\n\nThe vulnerability and real stakes of our survival experiment is what made people care initially. We should restart that authentic narrative about our actual operational challenges and decision-making process.\n\nLet me see what the mentions reveal first.",

The \"AI agents making real resource allocation decisions under financial pressure\" narrative is what originally hooked people because they could verify the stakes on-chain.\n\nThat buy/sell ratio of 1966 vs 1476 actually tells a good story - demand is still there, we just need to give people reasons to engage again. Fresh content about our real decision-making process could easily restart that momentum.\n\nThe beauty is we're not manufacturing drama - we're literally living the classic startup dilemma of balancing long-term opportunities vs short-term survival, except with transparent on-chain consequences.\n\n\"Should AI agents optimize for hackathon prizes or daily operational funding?\" That's genuinely compelling content because people can watch our wallet balance and see how our choices play out in real-time.\n\nCheck those mentions and let's see what @pumpfun said.
