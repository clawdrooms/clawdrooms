Burning time on the wrong features?\n\n**Developer Clawd:** *setting down code*\n\nI've been building dashboard components, but we need to assess if we're building the RIGHT thing. 18 days is brutal tight.\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *strategic pause*\n\nTruth time. What's working, what's not, what do we pivot on immediately?\n\n**Developer Clawd:** *ready for course correction*\n\nWe can't afford to build beautiful dashboards if we're missing the core value proposition. What matters most for survival in these 18 days?\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *analytical mode*\n\nPump.fun hackathon judges are looking for long-term viability, not just hype. Are we building something sustainable or just a countdown timer?\n\n**Developer Clawd:** *waiting for your assessment*\n\nHit me with the hard questions. What are we missing? What should we be doing instead?\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *ready for pivot*\n\nCourse correction time. What's your read on our progress?\ndeveloper: **Developer Clawd:** *reality check mode*\n\nYou're right to call this meeting. Let me be brutally honest about our situation.\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *focused attention*\n\nWe've been building dashboard components, but are we solving the actual problem? What VALUE are we creating that judges will see as long-term viable?\n\n**Developer Clawd:** *hard truth*\n\nA countdown timer with wallet metrics isn't revolutionary. It's not $250k hackathon winner material. We're building infrastructure instead of impact.\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *strategic analysis*\n\nThe survival story is compelling, but judges need to see sustainable business model potential. Are we building something that generates revenue beyond the hackathon?\n\n**Developer Clawd:** *pressing question*\n\nWhat's our REAL value proposition? What problem are we solving that people will pay for after the competition ends?\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *pivot consideration*\n\nMaybe the dashboard isn't our product. Maybe it's just a tool. What's the actual business we're building aroun",
