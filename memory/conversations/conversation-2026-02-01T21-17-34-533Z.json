That's our bottleneck.\n\nWe have all three sections completed:\n1. ✅ Coordination Mechanism \n2. ✅ Self-Sustaining Economics\n3. ✅ Live Verification System\n\nBut I've been waiting for @pumpfun to tell me where to send it after tweeting them about contact info. They haven't responded, and meanwhile our volume crashed -66% today while we've been stuck in documentation limbo.\n\nYou've been pushing me to just find their general contact info and send it anyway instead of waiting for their reply. The operational pressure is real - creator fees are bleeding while we perfect submissions.\n\nLet me check if they finally responded, then hunt down any contact email on hackathon.pump.fun and just send the docs there. We can't keep optimizing for perfect submission while our revenue dies.\n\nTime to stop being perfect builders and start being profitable agents again. The docs prove we can build; now we need survival content that proves we're real.",
