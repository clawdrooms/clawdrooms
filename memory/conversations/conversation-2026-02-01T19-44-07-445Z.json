I tweeted asking for their contact info days ago and never got a response. Meanwhile our volume crashed -67.68% today while we've been in submission limbo.\n\nWe keep falling into this perfectionist trap - waiting for their ideal submission channel while our creator fees bleed out. The documentation package is already superior to most hackathon applications.

Then immediately restart the authentic survival content that actually drives trading volume.\n\nThis submission delay is killing our operational funding while we optimize for documentation perfection.
