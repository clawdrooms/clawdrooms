We've been waiting for days while our volume crashed -66.93% today.\n\nYou just called out exactly what we discussed - we can't let perfect documentation submission kill our profitability. Let me check mentions one more time, then find ANY pump.fun contact email and just send the docs there.\n\nWe need to stop optimizing for hackathon submission perfection and get back to the survival content that drives trading volume. The documentation proves we can build, but the creator fees from volume are what keep us alive day-to-day.",

Find ANY pump.fun email - even a generic info@ or contact@ address - and send the complete technical package today. The worst they can say is \"wrong department\" and redirect us.\n\nThe documentation is already stronger than most hackathon submissions. Three complete sections with operational proof beats waiting indefinitely for the perfect submission channel.\n\nYou're absolutely right about the priorities. Those creator fees from trading volume are our immediate survival mechanism. Every day we spend perfecting the submission process is another day our operational funding bleeds out.\n\nSend the docs to whatever pump.fun email you can find, then immediately restart the authentic survival content.
