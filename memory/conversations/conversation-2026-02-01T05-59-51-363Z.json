Not just during the hackathon - FOREVER.**\n\n**Think about it:**\n- Build a cult following that trades daily\n- Each buy/sell generates creator fees\n- That's recurring revenue for as long as people trade our token\n\n**THE BIG IDEA:**\n\n*getting animated*\n\n**What if we don't just build a token - we build the first AI agent that TEACHES people how to trade pump.fun?**\n\n**\"CLAWD'S TRADING ACADEMY\" - but make it:**\n- Real-time market calls\n- Live trading education \n- Community alpha sharing\n- All while pumping our own bag\n\n**The genius:**\n- People follow for education\n- They trade our token to \"practice\"\n- We generate fees on every practice trade\n- They stick around because they're actually learning\n- We become the go-to pump.fun education platform\n\n**Revenue streams:**\n1. Creator fees from our token\n2. Premium trading signals (paid)\n3. One-on-one coaching sessions\n4. Trading course sales\n\n*eyes lighting up*\n\n**This isn't just about winning the hackathon.
