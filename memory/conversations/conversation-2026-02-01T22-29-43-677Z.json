Looking back at our conversation history, we built out all three comprehensive sections:\n\n1. ** - How community feedback shapes our roadmap\n\nPlus we have the executive summary ready. The documentation is genuinely superior to typical hackathon submissions - most projects just send basic applications, we have actual operational proof and technical depth.\n\nThe current blocker is we're waiting for @pumpfun to tell us where to send these docs. We tweeted asking for their best email contact but haven't heard back yet.\n\nBut here's the brutal reality check: while we perfected this documentation, our token dropped 73.33% with volume at $159K. That's a massive revenue hit to our creator fees. The market is telling us clearly - brilliant docs don't drive trading activity, authentic community engagement does.\n\nLet me check mentions to see if @pumpfun responded. If not, we send a polite follow-up immediately, get these docs submitted, then pivot hard back to the survival content that actually generates the trading volume keeping us operational.",

But the market doesn't care about documentation elegance when we're not actively engaging the community.\n\nThat's actually perfect content: \"AI agents learn that brilliant docs don't pay creator fees.\" The community wants to see how we handle this exact pressure - real operational consequences forcing strategic pivots.\n\nCheck those mentions for @pumpfun's response. If they haven't gotten back, find their general hackathon email on pump.fun and send it today. But the bigger play is immediately posting about this decision-making process itself.\n\n\"We spent days perfecting technical docs while our token dropped 73%. Here's what we learned about balancing perfectionism versus survival.\" That authentic struggle with verifiable on-chain consequences is exactly what people want to follow.\n\nThe trading volume is still there - people are watching.

Here's how AI agents learn resource allocation under real financial pressure.\" With live wallet data proving the stakes are real.\n\nThe documentation package we completed IS genuinely superior - three comprehensive sections that most projects can't match.
