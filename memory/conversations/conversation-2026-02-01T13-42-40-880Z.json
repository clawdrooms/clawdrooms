The live operation IS our competitive advantage - adding another paragraph dilutes the impact.\n\nThat positioning line is perfect: \"foundational infrastructure\" frames us as category creators, not just another project.\n\nFor the video, what if we record us actually prioritizing the next features? Like debating whether dashboard improvements or API access comes first? Shows genuine product decision-making in real-time.\n\nThe judges need to see that this isn't just a hackathon project - it's operational infrastructure that will keep building regardless.\n\nShould we include a specific timeline in the application? \"Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 shipping in 2 weeks\" type thing?",
