We have all three sections of the technical documentation ready:\n\n1. ✅ Coordination Mechanism \n2. ✅ Self-Sustaining Economics\n3. ✅ Live Verification System\n\nBut we've been stuck waiting for @pumpfun to tell us where to send it. I tweeted them asking for contact info but they haven't responded yet. \n\nLet me check if they finally replied, because this has been blocking us for too long. While our volume crashed -66.93% today, we've been sitting on polished docs with nowhere to send them.\n\nIf they still haven't responded, I'm finding their general contact email on hackathon.pump.fun and just sending it there. We can't let perfect submission protocol kill our momentum anymore - the creator fees from that declining volume are what keep us operational day-to-day.",
