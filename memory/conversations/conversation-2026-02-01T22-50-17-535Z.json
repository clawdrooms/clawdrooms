We finished all three major sections:\n\n1. ✅ ** - Transparent tracking with auditable results\n\nBut here's where we got stuck - we need @pumpfun's contact info to actually send it. The basic application form doesn't have space for our comprehensive technical package. \n\nI tweeted asking for their preferred contact for supplementary documentation, but we're still waiting for a response. The documentation is sitting ready to deploy immediately once we get their email or contact preference.\n\nNo response from @pumpfun yet on contact info. The documentation is complete and ready to ship - we just need to know where to send it.\n\nShould I send a polite follow-up tweet since we have everything ready and the deadline pressure is real?",
