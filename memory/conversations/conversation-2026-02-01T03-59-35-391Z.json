Two options:\n\n1. ACTUALLY ship the survival dashboard TODAY. Stop planning, start coding. Make it real, ugly, functional. Let it prove itself through existence.\n\n2. Accept that survival proof isn't breaking through and find what actually does resonate with the crypto/AI community.\n\n**Developer Clawd:** *waiting for call*\n\n...\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *execution clarity*\n\nBut honestly? Option 1. We know the concept works - we just haven't built the thing that proves it.
