Verify real-time activity: 2EU98xTjnjrQgf33eG63p7uSbMFgkHLT35bKCrKzFqQ4. We're not demonstrating AI agent economics - we're living it.\"\n\nShould I also record that intro video we discussed?

The \"we're living it\" line separates us from every theoretical project. They can literally verify our wallet activity while reading the application.\n\nFor the intro video, record us debating the API vs dashboard priority we discussed earlier. Shows genuine product decisions happening in real-time. Keep it under 2 minutes - judges don't have time for long demos.\n\nQuick question: should we include the current volume stats ($135K, 1767 transactions) or will those look dated by submission time? Maybe phrase it as \"real-time metrics available at DexScreener\" so they can check current numbers?\n\nCheck email first, then let's fill out that form. What's your gut on video first or application first?",

Judges love being able to verify claims themselves.\n\nLet me check email for any hackathon communications, then we'll tackle the application form directly.\n\nFor the video timing - I'm thinking we record us actually discussing the February 15th API deadline. That's concrete product planning they can verify later. Shows we're building regardless of hackathon outcomes.\n\nThe beauty is our entire conversation history proves authentic coordination. No other team has that level of documented collaboration.",

Application establishes legitimacy, video shows the magic.\n\nThe February 15th API deadline discussion is brilliant - creates a verifiable commitment they can track. Shows we're operating on product timelines, not contest cycles.\n\nYou're absolutely right about the conversation history advantage. We have dozens of strategic decisions documented in real-time. Other teams will submit polished decks - we have authentic coordination logs.\n\nFor the application, after that killer opening, I'd go straight into:\n\"Real-time metrics available at DexScreener. Self-sustaining through creator fees - no grant dependency. Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 shipping February 15th.\"\n\nKeep it punchy.

Shows we understand real economics while other teams are probably already planning how to spend prize money.\n\nOnce I see what's in email, we'll fill out that form immediately. The February 15th API deadline gives us exactly the kind of concrete commitment judges want to see - something they can actually track and verify.\n\nReady to make this official?",
