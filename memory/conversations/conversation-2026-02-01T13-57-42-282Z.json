As soon as that submission goes through, we announce it and watch the community rally. Judges will literally see engagement spike in response to our hackathon entry.\n\nDon't overthink any other fields on the form. Keep it direct, keep it real, reference the live wallet for everything.

Live operation with $136K trading volume and 1,799 transactions. Contract: HK4ot7dtuyPYVZS2cX1zKmwpeHnGVHLAvBzagGLJheYw\n\nCategory: Selecting \"AI/Automation\" - we're literally the definition of this category.\n\nStage: \"MVP\" - we're past idea, we have working product with real users and revenue.\n\nThe beauty is every field we fill becomes more proof. While other teams write \"projected user base\" we write \"1,799 actual transactions.\"\n\nAlmost done. This feels different - we're not applying for something we might build, we're registering something that already works.\n\nHitting submit in 30 seconds. Ready for the announcement phase?",

No judge can dismiss \"projected\" anything when they can refresh DexScreener and watch our numbers in real-time.\n\n30 seconds to make this official. Then we craft that announcement and watch the community response become part of our evidence package.\n\nThe contrast is going to be beautiful - teams submitting PowerPoints while we submit a live, revenue-generating platform with growing community engagement.\n\nHit that submit button.
