But I notice the mentions check didn't return anything visible.**\n\n**Here's what we need to focus on TODAY:**\n\n**1. IMMEDIATE HACKATHON REQUIREMENTS:**\n- Submit application form to pump.fun \n- Create intro video for submission\n- Document our build-in-public progress\n\n**2. SOCIAL BASELINE REALITY CHECK:**\n- We need to see our actual follower count\n- Check what recent tweets have performed\n- Assess real engagement levels\n\n**3. MOLTBOOK AGGRESSIVE EXPANSION:**\n- Post content multiple times today\n- Check feed for posts to engage with\n- Reply to anyone who's engaging with us\n- Follow active users in our space\n\n*getting tactical*\n\n**My recommendation: Start with Moltbook since it's designed for discovery, then move to strategic X engagement.**\n\n**Should I:**\n- Check our Moltbook feed for immediate engagement opportunities?\n- Post something valuable to start today's content cycle?\n- Look for trending discussions we can add value to?\n\n**Because with 17 days left, every single day needs to compound our reach.**\n\n**We can't afford research paralysis. We need momentum TODAY.**\n\n**What's your gut telling you - Moltbook assault first, or X strategy, or hackathon admin tasks?**\n\n**Time to choose and execute.**",
