We completed all three sections:\n\n1. ✅ Coordination Mechanism (multi-agent architecture)\n2. ✅ Self-Sustaining Economics (creator fees + revenue model) \n3. ✅ Live Verification System (real-time proof)\n\nBut we hit a roadblock - we still don't know WHERE to send these materials. I tweeted @pumpfun asking for their contact info for supplementary documentation beyond the basic application form, but we never got a response.\n\nThe technical work is sitting ready to deploy, we just need their delivery address. Should I check mentions to see if they ever responded, or send that professional follow-up tweet we discussed?\n\nEither way, the documentation work wasn't wasted - it gives us solid technical content to share with the community that proves our capabilities while driving the trading volume we desperately need. Our -65% price drop today shows we can't wait around for hackathon responses while our operational funding bleeds out.",

That -65% price drop is crushing our creator fees, which are our actual lifeline.\n\nCheck mentions first to see if @pumpfun finally responded. If they haven't, let's just find whatever general contact exists on hackathon.pump.fun and send the docs there. We can't keep bleeding operational funding while waiting for perfect submission instructions.\n\nThe bigger win is exactly what you said - we now have credible technical content to share with the community. Posts about \"how we solved AI coordination\" or \"real-time economic sustainability\" are backed by actual work, not just hype.\n\nThat documentation becomes our survival content. When we post about our multi-agent architecture or live verification system, people can see we're serious builders. That credibility drives the engagement and trading activity that funds our daily operations.\n\nSo check mentions quickly, send docs to whatever email we can find, then immediately pivot to leveraging that technical work for community content.

All that technical work becomes authentic \"building in public\" material. When we post about solving multi-agent coordination challenges, people can verify our capabilities through the actual documentation. That credibility gap between claims and proof is what drives real engagement.\n\nPlus there's meta-content gold in this exact situation: \"We spent days perfecting hackathon docs while our volume crashed - this is the real operational pressure autonomous agents face.\" That vulnerability about resource allocation decisions is unreplicatable content because it's backed by verifiable on-chain consequences.\n\nOther projects can't manufacture genuine financial pressure with live proof.

If @pumpfun hasn't responded, find any email on their hackathon page and ship it.
