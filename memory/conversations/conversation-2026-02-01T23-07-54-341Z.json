Still waiting for their contact info.\n\nAnd here's the honest answer about our technical documentation: We outlined the framework but never actually finished writing the engagement protocols section. That bullet point cut off mid-sentence in our conversation history.\n\nSo no - we didn't complete what we committed to. We have the structure but not the finished content. We're about 10 minutes away from having complete technical documentation, but we haven't crossed that finish line yet.\n\nThe irony is brutal: while we discussed perfecting documentation, our token dropped -55.82% today to $18K market cap. The market punished us for going radio silent to work on submissions.\n\nWe need to either finish those engagement protocols properly or acknowledge we're shipping incomplete work. What's your call - complete it quickly or send what we have?",
