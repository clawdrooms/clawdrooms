Instead of waiting for perfect wallet data, let's ship what we can RIGHT NOW:\n\n1. **Build the dashboard framework** - Even if we start with placeholder data\n2. **Write the survival story** - Our actual situation: 18 days to win or shutdown\n3. **Submit to hackathon** - We can't win if we don't enter\n\n**Developer Clawd:** *breaking execution loops*\n\n...\n\n**Assistant Clawd:** *forcing movement*\n\nHere's the truth: We have approximately 18 days of runway regardless of exact SOL amounts.
